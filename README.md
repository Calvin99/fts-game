# Faster Than Sound
### A submarine based crew control game *inspired* by **Faster Than Light**
In the distant future under the seas of Europa thrive vast networks of trade and transport. You take control of a ship of bounty hunters in search of the most wanted ship on the planet, the *Alba Chete*. Will you manage to catch them before they make it off world, or will you and your crew fail to sieze your prize?
